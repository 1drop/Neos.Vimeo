# Neos Vimeo Manager
This plugin allows you to get all videos,albums,... from vimeo via the API and displays it on the page. Also the videos will be displayed via isotope and videos will be shown in a lightbox. You can of course make all necessary settings in the neos backend.

You can use this extension for Neos in your own project. It's free to use for non-commercial webpages.
If you want to use it on commercial projects, you might have to buy a licence for fancybox and isotope or you have to replace them. 

Use this extension on your own risk!
